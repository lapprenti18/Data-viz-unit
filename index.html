      <h6 id="IntroductionText"> Hello everyone, <br>
        I'm a student in IT and I don't know yet which company I want to join in the future or which section I want to be in.<br>
        If you have the same profile as me, this website is for you. <br>

        I have to create a project for my school and I decided to do a website that will help me choose my future company.<br>
        On <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries">kaggle.com</a> I found a dataset with the salary of the employees of the FAANG companies.<br>
        I choose this dataset to learn some data about the tech company.<br>

        <br>
        First of all, I had more than 1600 companies so I extracted the top ten. <br>
          To see if my data is accurate, I decided to show how much data I have for each company. <br>
          <br>
          As we can see: <br>
          - the one with the most data is <span id="Amazon">Amazon</span> with 8124 employee information <br>
          - the one with the least data is <span id="IBM">IBM</span> with 906 employee information <br>
          Each company will have their own color for the rest of the website. <br>
          <span id="Amazon">Amazon</span>
          <span id="Apple">Apple</span>
          <span id="Facebook">Facebook</span>

        Cool ! Now that we know which company has the most data,<br>
        let's see which job starts with the best salary.<br>
        There are a lot of jobs, and not all of them are in IT.<br>
        I decided to keep them to be able to compare them with the IT jobs.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; You can select: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The average IT TOP 3 is:<br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; - Average salary &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <span id="IT1">Data Scientist</span><br>

    <div id="TenYearSalary">
      <h3 id="Introduction"> Ten first years salary.</h3>
      <h6 id="TenYearSalaryText"> For now, I'm more interested in becoming a Software Engineer.<br>
           I want to know how much I can expect for the first ten years.<br>
          <br>
          You can compare every curve in the first line chart,<br>
          or analyse them on the others line charts.<br>
          <br>
          For most of the companies, in ten years, your salary will increase around 100k.<br>
          There are some exceptions like <span id="Facebook">Facebook</span> and <span id="Google">Google</span> where you can expect 200k,<br>
          on the contrary <span id="Intel"> Intel </span> will increase less than the others, around 60k.<br>

    <div id="WordMap">
      <h3 id="Introduction"> Company location.</h3>
      <h6 id="WordMapText"> If you are has excited as I am, the next question you want to ask me is:
        "Where can I find those companies ?" <br>
        <br>
        No worries,<br>
        I decided to use a world map to show you where they are globaly located. (You can select each company.)<br>
        There are three other maps to zoom on the US, Europe and Oceania.<br>
        <br>
        As we can see, most of the companies are located in Europe and the USA.<br>
        So, if you want more opportunities, you should move to one of those two continents.<br>

      <h3 id="Introduction"> Conclusion.</h3>
      <h6 id="ConclusionText"> I hope you enjoyed this website<br>
        And I hope it helped you for your choice.<br>
        <br>
        Personally, I'm going to apply for <span id="Google">Google</span> and <span id="Apple">Apple</span> for the next 10 years.<br>
        If you want to join any of those companies,
        see you soon.<br>
